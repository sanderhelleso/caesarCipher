# caesarCipher
First used by Julius Caesar, the Caesar Cipher is one of the more well-known older historical encryption methods. While you certainly wouldnt want to use it in todays modern world, a long time ago it might have done the trick. Play Around with different text below. Simply enter some text and press either "Decrypt" to decrypt a encrypted message or "Encrypt" to encrypt a message. Have Fun!
